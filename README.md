# Gender Classification Dataset through create a dashboard for data visualization or for prediction

## Introduction : 
Gender classification is an essential task in the field of computer vision that has gained significant attention in recent years. There are various factors that can be used to differentiate between male and female faces, such as long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. 

The dataset contains a total of 5000 people data, each labeled as male or female. In addition to gender labels, the dataset also includes measurements of several facial features that are known to differ between genders. These features include long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. The dataset is designed to be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for gender classification based on facial features.

To demonstrate the use of this dataset, we created a dashboard using the Streamlit framework that allows users to upload images and receive gender classification predictions based on the facial features measured in the dataset. This dashboard can be used as the basis for an app that provides gender classification predictions for uploaded images.

## Data Description : 
* Data Collection : The dataset was collected from kaggle data set . To ensure that the dataset contained a diverse set of data, the search queries were varied in terms of ethnicity, age, and hairstyle.
* Data Labeling : Each line in the dataset was labeled as either male or female based on visual inspection by human annotators. In addition to gender labels, seven facial features were also measured for each image: long hair, forehead width, forehead height, nose width, nose length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. These measurements were made using a combination of manual and automated methods.
* Data Preprocessing : Prior to model training, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure that all images were of uniform size and orientation. The facial feature measurements were also standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
* Data Statistics : The dataset contains a total of 5000, with approximately 50% of the information labeled as male and 50% labeled as female. The average values for each of the facial features are as follows: long hair, forehead width, forehead height , nose width , nose length , lips thinness , and distance between nose and lips. The standard deviations for each feature are also provided in the dataset.
* Data Visualization : To provide a visual representation of the dataset, we generated a set of sample images along with their corresponding feature measurements. These visualizations provide insight into the characteristics of the dataset and the differences between male and female faces.
* Data Split : To evaluate the performance of the gender classification model, the dataset was split into a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to train the gender classification model, while the validation set was used to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Data Access : The dataset, along with the corresponding facial feature measurements, is available for download https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset?resource=download . The dataset is provided in .csv format and includes instructions for loading the data into Python. Additionally, the dashboard code and instructions for running in dashboard.
