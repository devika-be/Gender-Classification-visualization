# Gender Classification Dataset through create a dashboard for data visualization or for prediction

## Introduction : 
Gender classification is an essential task in the field of computer vision that has gained significant attention in recent years. There are various factors that can be used to differentiate between male and female faces, such as long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. 

The dataset contains a total of 5000 people data, each labeled as male or female. In addition to gender labels, the dataset also includes measurements of several facial features that are known to differ between genders. These features include long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. The dataset is designed to be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for gender classification based on facial features.

To demonstrate the use of this dataset, we created a dashboard using the Streamlit framework that allows users to upload images and receive gender classification predictions based on the facial features measured in the dataset. This dashboard can be used as the basis for an app that provides gender classification predictions for uploaded images.

## Data Description : 
* Data Collection : The dataset was collected from kaggle data set . To ensure that the dataset contained a diverse set of data, the search queries were varied in terms of ethnicity, age, and hairstyle.
* Data Labeling : Each line in the dataset was labeled as either male or female based on visual inspection by human annotators. In addition to gender labels, seven facial features were also measured for each image: long hair, forehead width, forehead height, nose width, nose length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. These measurements were made using a combination of manual and automated methods.
* Data Preprocessing : Prior to model training, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure that all images were of uniform size and orientation. The facial feature measurements were also standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
* Data Statistics : The dataset contains a total of 5000, with approximately 50% of the information labeled as male and 50% labeled as female. The average values for each of the facial features are as follows: long hair, forehead width, forehead height , nose width , nose length , lips thinness , and distance between nose and lips. The standard deviations for each feature are also provided in the dataset.
* Data Visualization : To provide a visual representation of the dataset, we generated a set of sample images along with their corresponding feature measurements. These visualizations provide insight into the characteristics of the dataset and the differences between male and female faces.
* Data Split : To evaluate the performance of the gender classification model, the dataset was split into a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to train the gender classification model, while the validation set was used to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Data Access : The dataset, along with the corresponding facial feature measurements, is available for download https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset?resource=download . The dataset is provided in .csv format and includes instructions for loading the data into Python. Additionally, the dashboard code and instructions for running in dashboard.

## Visualization : 
* Scatter plot matrix: A scatter plot matrix could be used to visualize the relationships between pairs of features in the dataset, such as long_hair vs. forehead_width, nose_width vs. nose_length, and so on. This could help identify any patterns or correlations that may be useful for gender classification.
* Bar chart: A bar chart could be used to show the distribution of gender labels in the dataset, such as the number of male and female examples. This could provide insight into the balance of the dataset and any potential class imbalance issues.
* Histograms: Histograms could be used to visualize the distribution of each individual feature in the dataset, such as the distribution of forehead_height values. This could help identify any potential outliers or unusual patterns in the data.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix could be used to visualize the performance of the gender classification model on a test set. This could show the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, and help evaluate the accuracy and precision of the model.
* Dashboard screenshot: A screenshot of the gender classification dashboard created using Streamlit could be included to provide a visual example of the final product. This could show the user interface, input features, and output predictions of the dashboard.

## Algorithms : 
1) Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification tasks such as gender classification. It works by fitting a logistic function to the input features to predict the probability of a binary outcome.
2) Decision Trees: Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm that work by recursively partitioning the input space based on the most informative features. It can handle both categorical and continuous features, and can be used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
3) Random Forests: Random Forests are an extension of Decision Trees that involve building multiple trees using random subsets of the input features and samples. This can improve the robustness and accuracy of the model.
4) Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs are a powerful algorithm that work by finding the hyperplane that maximally separates the input data points based on their class labels. SVMs can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets by using kernel functions.
4) Neural Networks: Neural Networks are a powerful class of machine learning algorithms that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including gender classification. They involve constructing a network of interconnected neurons that can learn complex non-linear relationships between the input features and the output label.
5) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm that works by assigning a new data point to the class of its k-nearest neighbors in the training set. It can handle both continuous and categorical features, and can be used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

These are just a few examples of algorithms that could be used for gender classification. The choice of algorithm may depend on the size and complexity of the dataset, as well as the specific requirements of the application.

## Methodology :
* Data Preparation: First, the dataset needs to be prepared by cleaning and preprocessing the data. This may involve removing missing values, handling outliers, and scaling or normalizing the features. It's also important to split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* Feature Selection: Next, feature selection techniques can be used to identify the most informative features for gender classification. This can help reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve the performance of the model. Some popular feature selection techniques include recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis, and mutual information.
* Model Selection: Once the features are selected, various machine learning algorithms can be trained and tested on the dataset to identify the best-performing model for gender classification. This may involve comparing the performance of different algorithms using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Model Tuning: After selecting the best-performing algorithm, the model can be further optimized by tuning hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. This can help improve the performance of the model and reduce overfitting.
* Model Deployment: Once the final gender classification model is trained and optimized, it can be deployed into a dashboard using Streamlit. This involves creating a user interface that allows users to input the relevant features and obtain a gender classification prediction. It's important to ensure that the dashboard is user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users.
* Dashboard Testing: Finally, the gender classification dashboard should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it's working as intended and providing accurate predictions. This may involve using various testing techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Any bugs or issues should be addressed promptly to ensure the smooth functioning of the dashboard.

These are just a few steps in a potential methodology for creating a gender classification dashboard using Streamlit. The specific approach may vary depending on the requirements of the project and the characteristics of the dataset.

## Conclusion : 
      In conclusion, creating a gender classification dashboard using a dataset with features such as long_hair, forehead_width, forehead_height, nose_width, nose_length, lips_thin, and distance_nose_lip can be a useful tool for various applications such as social media, dating apps, and e-commerce websites.
