# Gender Classification Dataset through create a dashboard for data visualization or for prediction

## Introduction : 
Gender classification is an essential task in the field of computer vision that has gained significant attention in recent years. There are various factors that can be used to differentiate between male and female faces, such as long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. 
The dataset contains a total of 5000 people data, each labeled as male or female. In addition to gender labels, the dataset also includes measurements of several facial features that are known to differ between genders. These features include long hair, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lips thinness, and the distance between the nose and lips. The dataset is designed to be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for gender classification based on facial features.
To demonstrate the use of this dataset, we created a dashboard using the Streamlit framework that allows users to upload images and receive gender classification predictions based on the facial features measured in the dataset. This dashboard can be used as the basis for an app that provides gender classification predictions for uploaded images.
